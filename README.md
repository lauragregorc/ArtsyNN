# Neural Art Transfer Using Neural Networks
A tutorial to try neural art transfer using neural networks.

Theory:
- [A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576)
- [Semantic Style Transfer and Turning Two-Bit Doodles into Fine Artworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01768)

Inspired by the following githup repos:
- [alexjc/neural-doodle](https://github.com/alexjc/neural-doodle)
- [gargimahale/Doodle](https://github.com/gargimahale/Doodle/blob/master/stylize.py) 

Content:
- [neural_transfer](neural_transfer.ipynb)
Simple cnn for combining style and content image.
- [nerual_transfer_using_image_segmentation](neural_transfer_using_image_segmentation.ipynb)
Advanced approach, where segmentation maps are used in order to define classes.
- [transfer.py](transfer.py) 
A fast tensorflow implementation based on [gargimahale/Doodle](https://github.com/gargimahale/Doodle/blob/master/stylize.py) which implements Neural Doodles.
